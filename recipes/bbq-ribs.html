        <li>4 cloves garlic, sliced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon paprika</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons chili powder</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
        <li>1/2 cup dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup ketchup</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chili sauce</li>
        <li>1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon dry mustard</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, crushed</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Place ribs on a rack
            in a shallow roasting pan. Scatter 4 cloves of sliced garlic over
            ribs. Cover and bake for 2 1/2 hours. Cool slightly.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a small bowl, mix together white sugar, paprika, salt, black pepper,
            chili powder, and ground cumin. Rub spices over cooled ribs. Cover and 
            refrigerate overnight.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a small saucepan, mix together brown sugar, apple cider vinegar, ketchup,
            chili sauce, Worcestershire sauce, lemon juice, onion, dry mustard, and 1
            clove garlic. Simmer over medium-low heat, uncovered, for 1 hour. Reserve
            a small amount for basting; the remainder is a dipping sauce.
        </li>
        <li>Preheat grill for medium heat.</li>
        <li>Place ribs on grill. Grill, covered, for about 12 minutes, basting with
            the reserved sauce, until nicely browned and glazed. Serve with remaining
            sauce for dipping.
        </li>
    </ol>
